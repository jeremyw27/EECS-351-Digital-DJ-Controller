# Description of files:
#
#   - echo2.py: This is a working version of the echo function with no real-time manipulation. 
#               A path to the wav file that the user wishes to manipulate is required in the script,
#               and the user is able to change the echo's delay, feedback, and number of repititions. 
#
#   - echo3.py: This is a working version of the echo function WITH real-time audio manipulation.
#               When run, a GUI appears with a button to allow the user to browse through their files
#               to choose the one they want. There are also two sliders for echo delay and feedback, and when 
#               changed, the audio changes based on the new parameters. The audio loops while the user
#               manipulates the audio.                    
#
#   - loopingrealtime.py: This is the looping function WITH real-time audio manipulation. This script processes
#                         audio files by applying progressively filtered segments using a low-pass filter
#                         and provides waveforms and spectrograms of the original and filtered signals.
