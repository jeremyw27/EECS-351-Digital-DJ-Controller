# Description of files:
#   - echo2.py: This is a working version of the echo function with no real-time manipulation. 
#               A path to the wav file that the user wishes to manipulate is required in the script,
#               and the user is able to change the echo's delay, feedback, and number of repititions. 
#
#   - looping.py: This is the looping function WITH real-time audio manipulation. This script processes
#                 audio files by applying progressively filtered segments using a low-pass filter
#                 and provides waveforms and spectrograms of the original and filtered signals.
